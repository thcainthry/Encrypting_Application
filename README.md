# Encrypting_Application
This is an encrypting application that we build in our Internet Security course of the 5th semester.

This code is a Python script that encrypts all of the regular files in the current working directory using the AES encryption algorithm, and deletes the original unencrypted files. It uses the 'pyAesCrypt' library to perform the encryption and the 'os' library to interact with the file system. The script prompts the user to enter a password, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the files. The encrypted files are saved with the '.aes' extension. After all of the files have been encrypted, the script prints a message indicating that the process is complete.
